**My Training on Dynamic Programming**

In my years of experience I've faced many challenges and used my skills to the maximum, but most of the jobs I've worked in did not require me to have a very complex or highly performant code.

That's why I feel that dynamic programming is the next step for me to hone my skills and bring it to the next level.
